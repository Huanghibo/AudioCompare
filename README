Run Instructions
----------------
To run our program in this directory, type one of:
   ./p4500 -f <file1.wav> -f <file2.wav>
   ./p4500 -f <file1.wav> -d <file2.wav>
   ./p4500 -d <file1.wav> -f <file2.wav>
   ./p4500 -d <file1.wav> -d <file2.wav>

Arguments following a "-f" argument must be a filename,
and arguments following a "-d" argument must be a directory
containing only audio files. Input files must be WAVE or MP3 files.
You may list the same file or directory twice.

There must be an executable called "python2.7"
in your path. You must also have the numpy module installed.
This is not present on all CCIS Linux machines, but it is present on some.

If errors are found, appropriate error messages
will be printed, and the program may continue if it can.
Match results will be printed as "NO MATCH" if two
non-matching files were compared, and "MATCH ..."
if two matching files were compared, listing the two
files that matched, and giving the match score.

Third-Party Software Acknowledgements
-------------------------------------
We make heavy use of Python's standard library.

We make heavy use of the libraries `numpy',
and `matplotlib'.

There are about 15 lines of code in FFT.py that
are a modified version of code inside
matplotlib. This usage was approved. The file
LICENSE.matplotlib license found in this directory
is the matplotlib license, included as required
when creating derivative works. More information
can be found in FFT.py.
