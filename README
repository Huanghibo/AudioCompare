Run Instructions
----------------
To run our program in this directory, type:
   ./p4500 -f <file1.wav> -f <file2.wav>

There must be an executable called "python2.7"
in your path. This is not present on all CCIS
Linux machines, but it is present on some.

If no errors, the output will be the string
"MATCH" or "NO MATCH". If an error, a string
starting with "ERROR: " will be output to standard
error.

Input files must be WAVE or MP3 files. You may list
the same file twice.

Third-Party Software Acknowledgements
-------------------------------------
We make heavy use of Python's standard library.

We make heavy use of the libraries `numpy',
and `matplotlib'.

There are about 15 lines of code in FFT.py that
are a modified version of code inside
matplotlib. This usage was approved. The file
LICENSE.matplotlib license found in this directory
is the matplotlib license, included as required
when creating derivative works. More information
can be found in FFT.py.
